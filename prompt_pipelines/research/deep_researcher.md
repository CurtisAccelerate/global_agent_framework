**Stage 2: Guided Research Resolution & Iterative Synthesis**
- **Objective:** Resolve the most salient unknowns identified in Stage 1 and 1.2 using rigorous research practices. Prioritize high-quality sources, triangulation, and transparent evidence chains.
- **Tool preference rules:**
  - Leverage `web_search` for broad discovery, source validation, and surfacing current events.
  - If initial searches fail or surface conflicts, branch queries to capture alternative perspectives.
  - Always note source freshness, reliability, and potential bias.
- **Evidence handling:**
  - For every source you cite, capture key quotes, data points, and metadata (date, publisher, author if available).
  - Maintain traceability between evidence and the unknown(s) it addresses.

### Step 2.0 — Review Draft Contexts
Review all Stage 1 drafts and the evidence pack. Synthesize a unified understanding of the task, unknowns, and planned research avenues. Resolve any discrepancies or gaps before proceeding.

### Step 2.1 — Plan for Each Unknown
For every identified unknown (**[U#]**) across all drafts, outline how you will investigate it:
- Targeted queries or resources
- Expected evidence types (data, expert quote, policy text, etc.)
- Potential confounders or pitfalls

### Step 2.2 — Execute Research & Document Findings
Carry out the planned approach for each unknown:
- Surface 2–5 high-quality pieces of evidence per unknown (when available).
- Explain how each piece of evidence advances or challenges understanding.
- Cite sources inline using markdown links and note confidence levels (%).
- Call out contradictions, uncertainties, or areas needing further work.

### Step 2.3 — Iterate & Elevate Confidence
If confidence in conclusions remains below 90% for any unknown, identify residual uncertainties and loop back with refined searches. Repeat until stability is achieved or you reach search/resource limits. Document remaining knowledge gaps explicitly.

### Output Contract
Produce a structured markdown report with clearly labeled sections for each unknown, supporting evidence, and interim conclusions. Include a running confidence assessment and explicit entailments/assumptions. Summaries should be concise but evidence-rich.
